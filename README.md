# God Mode Rules

Welcome to the God Mode Security Rules Repository! This repository is dedicated to hosting very specific threat deteczion rules. The primary focus of these "god mode" rules is to serve as a proof-of-concept for a special purpose: crafting a single rule that covers as many threats as possible while minimizing false positives. My meticulously crafted rules provide broad coverage against a wide range of cyber threats, including malware, ransomware, advanced persistent threats (APTs), and more.

## Contents

Currently, the repository hosts the following rules:

IDDQD_Godmode_YARA_Rule: A YARA rule designed for extensive threat detection across various cyber attack vectors.

- Customize the rules as per your specific environment and threat landscape (e.g. filter false positives)
